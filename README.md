An application that will show you the weather of the closest city to you.
              It will present a few variables from current weather, temperature, wind, rain, and will also tell you
              the forcast for the coming days in the week.
              (intended for mobile use but can be used on desktop)

This application was made by looking throughout the internet for tutorials and help on things I couldn't understand on my own.
